        Our symbolic adoption program follows guidelines inspired by the

        We collaborate with certified marine rescue centers and follow ethical principles aligned with global conservation organisations.

  <h2>About us</h2>
  <p>We are a small team of ocean lovers, biologists and volunteers dedicated to protecting sea turtles and preserving their natural habitat.

  <p><b>Vision:</b> we envision a future where sea turtles can swim freely in clean, safe oceans, without the dangers of pollution, fishing gear or habitat loss.
   Our long-term goal is to inspire global awareness and empower communities to take part in ocean protection, creating a lasting impact for future generations.</p>
  <p><b>Mission:</b> our mission is simple, to protect one turtle at a time.
   We work every day alongside marine rescue centers to save injured turtles, provide medical care, support rehabilitation and ensure they can return safely to the ocean.
   Through education, conservation programs and community involvement, we aim to reduce the threats these animals face and promote a healthier marine ecosystem.</p>
